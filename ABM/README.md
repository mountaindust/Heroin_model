# Agent-Based SPARH Model

This is the repository containing all of the code and data analysis tools for the SPARH agent-based model. SPARH is an abbreviation named after the classes considered in our model: Susceptible, Prescribed, Addicted, Recovered, and Heroin. 

### Contents
#### 1. [data_analysis](https://github.com/mountaindust/Heroin_model/tree/master/ABM/data_analysis)
- This contains all data analysis tools for the model. More information can be found directly on this page's README.
#### 2. The model itself
- I have not included a link for this header because this model is constantly changing as we update the code
- The model will always contain the suffix ".nlogo"
- This file is written in [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/), and to be able to run the GUI on your local machine, you will have to [download NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml). 

## Running the Model

![Network Picture](https://github.com/mountaindust/Heroin_model/blob/master/ABM/supporting_docs/network_picture.png)
Here is an example picture of the network. Here you can see that there are 20 turtles (individuals/nodes). 14 of them are Susceptible (blue), 2 are Prescribed (yellow), 2 are Addicted (red), 1 is Recovered (green), and 1 is Heroin (purple).
