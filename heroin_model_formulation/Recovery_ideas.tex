\noindent Ideas about ``recovery" class: \\ \\
-We have data on the number of ``addicted" individuals in 2015 for both opioids and heroin/fentanyl, but I believe this number would include individuals who are in recovery \\
-We don't have data on the number of individuals in our recovery class, because it includes those who are in active recovery AND those who have finished treatment successfully for their addiction (two different types of people)\\
-Most individuals go into short-term recovery (3-6 weeks long), and since 91\% of opioid addicts in recovery relapse back to addiction within 8 weeks and 70\% of heroin addicts relapse within 4 weeks, we may keep these individuals in the addiction class since they have not fully ``recovered," i.e. at a point where they have a high chance of not falling back into addiction. \\
-The recovery class would be for: individuals who continue treatment after some number of weeks or have successfully finished treatment. \\
-Right now, the recovery class consists of two very different types of people: those who are in short-term treatment who have a high chance of relapsing (essentially are still addicted) and those who have successfully recovered and are out of addiction. \\
-Making this change would allow us to have the recovery class be composed of individuals who have been addicted/are in a longer-term treatment so treated different than susceptibles and different than those in short-term treatment; could use data for the number of addicts being those just in A. \\

\noindent OR just keep the recovery class the way it is and just make assumption that those in recovery class are not considered addicted. \\

\noindent OR do 48,000-R(2015), but this would take out too many because this would also take out the number of individuals who are not addicted and have recovered from addiction. \\

\noindent OR from BlueCross BlueShield, 1 in every 10 Tennessean who needs substance abuse treatment receives it, and take out 4,800 from those in opioid addict class and 1,400 from those in heroin class. \\ %https://bettertennessee.com/health-brief-addiction/
