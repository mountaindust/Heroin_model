\textbf{Dr. James Choo} (owner and medical director of Pain Consultants of East TN) speaker at Science Forum at UT on 11/30/2018 \\
Opioid crisis: hallmark of deeper societal problems that are ignored (so discussed pain, suicide, and trauma) \\

\textbf{Main takeaways:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Need to change the language: it started as a prescription drug epidemic $\implies$ opioid crisis $\implies$ polysubstance abuse crisis (not just an opioid problem, it's a drug problem) $\implies$ trauma crisis (get away from stigma about pain and addiction and realize how closely linked to childhood trauma from ACE scores) 
\item[-] General physicians are sending individuals to pain consultants because they don't want to deal with the problem anymore (there is a long wait for seeing a pain consultant, have seen increase in suicides) 
\item[-] Suicides have increased with pain clinic closures, rules, regulations since instills fear in individuals who take opioids
\item[-] Some use Narcan multiple times in a week because they use it as a safety net and push their high up further 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pain:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Brain final organ that holds pain/houses anxiety and depression 
\item[-] 600 billion dollar problem from medical expenses and lost wages 
\item[-] Number 1 reason to access healthcare is pain
\item[-] How pain is treated is an issue of education; very few physicians/providers go to chronic pain lectures 
\item[-] Fewer opioids, but more deaths from heroin and fentanyl analogs 
\item[-] East TN problematic from intersection of I-40 and I-75, drug route down from Detroit 
\item[-] Legislation, closure of pain clinics, education, and insurance company changes
\item[-] People dying from polysubstance abuse (Narcan, suboxone, muscle relaxers, alcohol, fentanyl analogs, heroin, meth, cocaine); NOT just an opioid problem, it's a drug problem
\item[-] Some use Narcan multiple times in a week because they use it as a safety net and push their high up further 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Suicide:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] First time since 1960's that the US life expectancy has dropped in the US 
\item[-] Pain clinic closures, rules, regulations instill fear in individuals who take opioids, has led to suicidal thoughts and suicides (30 year high)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Trauma:} 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Underlying need for pain medication, as well as ``toxic stress" (especially that occurs at a young age, brain cannot recover from that fully)
\item[-] ACE scores (abuse, neglect, dysfunction at home) 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{TN organizations working on opioid epidemic:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] TN Together
\item[-] Metro Drug Coalition
\item[-] East TN Opioid Conference (2018 slides: $https://metrodrug.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/\\
Final-Slide-Deck-Revised-03.20.2018.pdf$)
\item[-] Memphis- Lebonhour Hospital 
\end{itemize}
