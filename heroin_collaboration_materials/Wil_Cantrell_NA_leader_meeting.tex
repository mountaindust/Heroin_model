\textbf{Wil Cantrell from Concord United Methodist Church and NA recovery group leaders Greg, Gary, Matt} on 11/27/2018 \\

\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Their specific NA group meets on Monday nights with food, worship, message on 1 of the 12 steps, then small groups afterward; 6 month program for 12 steps and then encourage to come for a lifetime as the goal is to have a change in lifestyle
\item[-] In order to be a leader, must have gone through addiction themselves, not anyone can lead
\item[-] Studies show peer groups just as good as professional
\item[-] Trying to lower DEMAND of opioids/drugs, not supply
\item[-] Addiction is viewed as an incurable disease and has a ripple effect that affects families and friends 
\item[-] Some people get an IEP from work in order to do an outpatient 30 day treatment
\item[-] Dry: out of rehab VS. sober: thinking healthfully/mind in correct state 
\item[-] If try to replace one drug with another, almost always people go back to primary drug of choice
\item[-] ``Drugs aren't my problem, they are the solution" is common way of thinking for addicts 
\item[-] Believed that 97\% of brain is subconscious and it takes 5 ears for healthy way of thinking to take over subconcious 
\item[-] Huge stigma
\item[-] Drugs response TO trauma and CREATES trauma
\item[-] Step 12: ``if you're going to keep it, give it away"
\item[-] Most meetings see a mixture of all drugs (they recommended going to Park40 AA meeting; they said will see people who struggle with pills there too)
\end{itemize}
