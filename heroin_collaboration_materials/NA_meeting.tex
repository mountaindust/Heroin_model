\textbf{Narcotics Anonymous} (VOL group) at St. John Lutheran Church, December 4, 2018 \\

\begin{itemize}
\item[-] It's a polysubstance abuse crisis (not just an opioid problem, it's a drug problem) and these groups welcome all drug addicted individuals, not just specific drug 
\item[-] Drug use stems from trauma and/or not being able to handle pain or bad feelings or circumstances in life
\item[-] I feel that prescription opioids are a specific case due to the misconceptions that people think it's safe since from a doctor, but then they get tangled in polysubstance abuse because they turn to alcohol or something else, for example, as a ``replacement" but doesn't heal their addiction 
\item[-] Saw a spectrum of recovery: someone was there for the first time 7 days sober from meth, another was nearing 1 year being clean, another had been recovering for 7 years
\item[-] Different issues in life; court dates coming up, children visitations, past homelessness
\item[-] Alcohol is a drug and addictive so not solution to their other addiction
\item[-] Stories shared about how even after having no desire to use for a while/clean, still has addictive habits in other areas of life: gambling, food, paying for half of something and then leaving the next half for a future payment, etc. 
\item[-] Feel lonely but the NA group has a huge sense of community
\item[-] Got chips/keytags at end marking how long been in recovery/sober 
\item[-]12 steps same as used in AA, about changing the way one thinks and lives, not just getting clean although that is the first goal 
\item[-] Open discussion: sit and listen if not an addict; closed: only addicts allowed. We would only attend meetings labeled "open and discussion."
